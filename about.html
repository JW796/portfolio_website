          Hi Iâ€™m James a self-taught Frontend Web Developer, who gets a thrill from focusing in on building excellent client-side experiences of Websites and Web Applications!
          <br>
          <br>
          Working in marketing opened my eyes to our ever-increasing dependency on outstanding technologies within business and in life. Similarly, my experience working closely with customer service teams to acquire firsthand feedback solidified the importance of a positive digital user experience in my mind. It was these ideas that fueled a desire to take on months of self-teaching so that I could help contribute in building digital assets that solve larger problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          Feel free to Connect or Follow me on my Linkedin where I post useful content related to Web Development and Programming. I'm open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me!
          <br>
          <br>
          I am confident that my skills can help contribute in building a positive digital experience for clients which leads to the overall success around a product or solution. Check out some of my work in the Projects section.
